Super cool tic-tac-toe project

## Resources

- [Websocket Support in ASP.NET Core - Basically a C# websocket getting started page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/websockets?view=aspnetcore-9.0)

## Notes

- Note at top of "Websocket Support in ASP.NET Core" page said that chrome/edge have http/2 websockets enabled by default but if you are in firefox you might have to enable it. Idk if we will/are going to use that specifically but just in case some error happens and you dont know why it is a good check
